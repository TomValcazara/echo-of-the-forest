# Echo of the Forest

**Echo of the Forest** is a short atmospheric narrative game created in Unity.  
You play as a wandering soul guided by echoes through a dark, mystical forest.  
By following the sounds and uncovering their sources, you reveal fragments of a story -  
a quiet reflection on sin, judgment, and the longing for belonging.
